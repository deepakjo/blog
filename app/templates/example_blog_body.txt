<p style="color:black;font-family:verdana;"> Edwin van der Sar will be remembered as one of Manchester United's best goalkeepers, and he was arguably as good as Peter Schmeichel was for the club. The Dutch 'keeper proved a worthy replacement for Schmeichel at Old Trafford when he arrived at the club from Fulham. The only problem was United fans had to wait six years between the Dane leaving and Van der Sar arriving in 2005. </p>

<p style="color:black;font-family:verdana;">Van der Sar saved the penalty which won United the 2008 Champions League final in Moscow against Chelsea.</p>

<p style="color:black;font-family:verdana;">The Dutchman correctly guessed that Nicolas Anelka would kick to his right during the penalty shoot-out, and stopped his effort to win United the European Cup for the third time in their history.</p>

<p style="color:black;font-family:verdana;">United had received a slice of luck when Terry missed, but there was nothing lucky about Van der Sar's decisive save from Anelka's penalty. The Dutchman, who is currently working as the CEO of Ajax, had done a lot of research ahead of the penalties.</p>
